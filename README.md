# SpeedrunEvent
Welcome to my repo, this repo is just a plugin that I needed for a video. If you want to use this, I'm not gonna write a wiki on how to use it because it's not
intended for the general public, but if you want to compile it yourself and use it I'm not stopping you :) (for those of you who actually want to do that, please
go to https://dev.seailz.com/speedrun) + the plugin is super customizable so feel free to do what ever you want with this.

For those developers out there, I MAY write an API for this, but I'm not sure at the moment. I'll post updates in this PR (https://github.com/IoyoCode/SpeedrunEvent/pull/6)

that's all I have to say :)

### Curent Status
I'm currently not sure if I want to carry on this project, so we may never see the completion of this if I don't want toðŸ˜­
